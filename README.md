# Artist-Portfolio-website
A portfolio website for an artist



I am entrusted with establishing an online social media influencer profile/website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project. The goal of this project is to measure my skill in core web development practices such as page layout setup, folder management, and application of essential layout concepts. The website will include multiple pages/sections, including the landing page, résumé page, gallery/portfolio page, about page, and contact page. I'll use a text editor to create a completely functional website that includes photos, JavaScript functionality, and CSS styling. My goal is to construct a website that follows web development standards, is search engine optimized, and passes SEO, speed, and browser compatibility tests.



This Social Media Influencer who uses art as his content. First and foremost, the landing page is intended to make a powerful first impression, with a large image of the influencer and a warm welcome message.

A consistent navigation bar and footer are incorporated on the remaining four pages to guarantee seamless navigation throughout the website. Users may simply explore different parts and find vital information thanks to this design choice. The navigation bar has simple links to the resume page, gallery, about me, and contact page, making it simple for users to get the information they need.

The gallery page includes a supplementary menu on the right side of the screen that allows visitors to browse between gallery pages. This layout is perfect for presenting the influencer's artwork, allowing readers to easily navigate across numerous pages of intriguing graphics.

The CV page includes a detailed description of the influencer's educational background, talents, and experience, whilst the gallery page is a specialized space for the influencer to display his or her artistic achievements.

Finally, the contact page has links to the influencer's social media accounts, allowing users to engage with them directly, as well as a contact form for inquiries or criticism.
